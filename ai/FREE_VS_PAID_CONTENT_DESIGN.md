# Free vs. Paid Content Design

## Overview

This document defines the user-facing content structure for the Case Analysis Report, specifying what users see before and after payment.

**Design Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Approved design, pending implementation
**Constraint:** Consumes frozen `issueDetectors.js` and `CaseAnalysisService.js` output—does not modify analysis logic.

---

## Content Philosophy

- **Preparation and clarity, not confrontation** — Position the service as helping users understand and document their situation
- **Customization over templates** — Emphasize that findings are derived from THEIR lease and facts
- **Informational framing** — No legal advice, no outcome predictions, no fear tactics
- **Calm, confident, renter-empowering tone**

---

## 1. Free Preview Content

### Case Confirmation
Reflects the user's specific inputs to build trust:

```
We analyzed your security deposit situation:
• Property: [property_address]
• Deposit: [deposit_amount]
• Move-out: [move_out_date]
• Days since move-out: [days_since_move_out]
```

### Headline Leverage Point
Shows the #1 ranked leverage point (highest `rank_weight`) in full.

**Example Title:**
> Your $1,500 deposit is 17 days past the standard Texas deadline

**Example Explanation (2–3 sentences):**
> Based on the information you provided, your landlord has held your security deposit for 47 days without returning it or providing a written explanation of any deductions. Texas Property Code establishes a 30-day timeline for landlords to act after a tenant moves out and provides a forwarding address. That deadline passed on January 14, 2026.

**Transition to Paid Content:**
> Your full report includes 3 additional findings based on your lease terms and the specific facts of your situation.

### Design Notes for Free Preview
| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Title with dollar amount and days | Immediately personal—uses THEIR numbers |
| Explanation | States facts, references statute generically, no predictions |
| Transition | Quantifies remaining value, emphasizes customization |

## 2. Paywall Justification Copy

Appears immediately after the free preview, before the payment CTA.

### Paragraph (3–4 sentences)
> Your full report goes deeper. We've analyzed your uploaded lease line-by-line and compared it against the timeline you provided and the requirements in the Texas Property Code. The result is a clear picture of where you stand—organized, documented, and ready for whatever step you decide to take next. Whether that's a conversation with your landlord, a written request, or simply understanding your options, you'll have the facts in one place.

### Bullet Points
> **Your full report includes:**
>
> - **All findings from your case** — not just the headline, but every relevant observation drawn from your lease and move-out facts
>
> - **Your lease language, highlighted** — exact clauses from your uploaded document, flagged where they relate to Texas deposit requirements
>
> - **A step-by-step roadmap** — practical next steps organized by priority, with checklists and links to public resources

## 3. Differentiator Statement

Answers: "How is this different from a generic security deposit article online?"

> Unlike just searching the web for generic statutes, our analysis of the actual language in your lease is employed to specifically target leverage points and cross-reference applicable Texas Property Code requirements. Your customized report lays out a detailed and specific plan of action unique to your situation to help you get your deposit back.

## 4. Paid Content: Leverage Points Section

### Section Header
> **Your Case Findings**

### Intro Paragraph
> The findings below were generated by cross-referencing three sources: the specific language in your uploaded lease, the timeline of events you provided, and publicly available Texas Property Code requirements. Each finding reflects your situation—not a generic checklist. Where your lease contains relevant clauses, we've included the exact text so you can see what applies to you.

### Example Leverage Point Titles (paid content)
| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Your landlord has not returned your deposit or provided an itemization |
| 2 | Your lease references a 60-day timeline, but Texas law establishes 30 days |
| 3 | Deductions for carpet cleaning may fall under normal wear and tear |

### Lease-Specific Clause Explanation
> When your lease includes language that conflicts with Texas statutory timelines or attempts to broaden deduction categories, we flag those clauses directly—this context can help you understand where your position may be stronger or where additional documentation could be useful.

## 6. Legal Safety Checklist

All content in this design:

- [x] Uses "may," "could," informational framing
- [x] References statutes generically ("Texas Property Code") without interpretation
- [x] Avoids "you should," "you must," "you are entitled to"
- [x] Makes no outcome predictions
- [x] Includes visible disclaimer in free preview
- [x] Positions service as preparation/documentation, not legal advice

---

## 7. Implementation Notes

To implement this structure, the frontend would:

1. Call the analysis endpoint (already built)
2. Extract `leverage_points[0]` for the free preview
3. Count `leverage_points.length - 1` for the "additional findings" teaser
4. Gate display of `leverage_points[1..n]`, `procedural_steps`, `lease_clause_citations`, and PDF generation behind `paymentStatus === 'paid'`

**No changes to `issueDetectors.js` or `CaseAnalysisService.js` required.**

## Rationale

### Why This Structure is Fair
- Real value before payment (one full leverage point, not a teaser)
- Proportional paywall (headline finding + additional findings)
- Explicit count of remaining findings—no inflated promises

### Why This Structure is Clear
- Case-specific confirmation builds trust
- Single headline finding avoids overload
- Explicit unlock list removes ambiguity

### Why This Structure is Persuasive
- Specificity creates trust (their dollar amounts, their dates)
- "Why this matters" connects facts to consequences
- Low friction CTA ($19.99 one-time, instant access)
